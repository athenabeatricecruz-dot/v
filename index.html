<blockquote> all salads aside, happy valentines day my babyy!! weird gift, right? well i worked hard on this sweetheart so i REALLY hope you read this. i spent every after school hours to code, publish, and write every single character by hand. you will read this in less than an hour, but it took me more than 15 to code this.
 yk those letters? it was a ruse. bleeh. okay— i'll tell you this right now at the start of this website because i'm going to say every single emotion, thought, and opinion 
 from the bottom of my heart. so please dont mind the bad writing okaayy? </blockquote>
 <p> thank you for the laughter, the sweet times, the inspiring moments, and the best highlights of my life. i genuinely don't know where i'd be without you. i mean— even now i dont know what i want to be but; i want to find it out with you. i know we're still young, still dumb, still broke, but i still love you as if i've known you my whole life. because you are my whole life. </p>

<p> i've loved you ever since i saw that glimmer of genuinity in your eyes. god, i'm so in love with you. </p>

<p>thank you for understanding, thank you for listening, thank you for venting, thank you for showing your true emotions. you don't know how much you truly mean to me and my undecided life. ethan, every step i'll take into growing,  each and every hardship will have a part dedicated to you. </p>

<p>i'll work hard to give you a life you deserve. i'll listen to make you feel safe. i'll love you to the moon and back. i'll walk on glass shards barefoot for you if you were on the other side. 

<p>so live. live happily, be cringe, laugh loudly, choose what you think is the best— because whatever choice and decision you have, i'll support you wholeheartedly. whether it's your career choice, lifestyle, opinion, or belief, i'll support you. whether you feel hopeless and want to die, i'll support you. whether you want to leave me,  i'll support you. not that it feels like an obligation for me to reciprocate the same amount of effort that you would give to me— but i would support you because i genuinely love you. not for your body, status, or out of pity; i REALLY love you. and i'd sacrifice just to call you mine over and over again. </p>

<p>i don't think i would be here without you. and the singular thought of you having a chance to be gone from my whole life in general keeps me up at night. id give up everything to feel your gentle touch. i'd travel every ring of hell just to see if you'll be mine. i'd do anything because i love you. i love the way you make me feel so girly and sweet and safe and comfy and loved and actually enjoyed being around you. </p>

<p>i love apples because apple pie makes me think of you. you make me feel like a warm, cinnamony and sweet person. you're my favorite fruit in the grocery, you're my favorite. my favorite cat is the face you make when you smile so genuinely. the way your cheeks dimples look like whiskers smile at me so warmly makes me feel oh so bubbly. every time i see anything guitar related makes me remember the compassion and love you have for the instrument. every time i see you play badminton reminds me of how determined you can be. every time i hear or notice something off about you i instantly get worried. </p>

<p>i see you in every hue of purple, in every star in the night sky, in every jin ramen in korean convience store, every high quality gel pen in a crappy department store— everything and anything will remind me of you. from a cat's whiskers to ocean waves at night, you're everywhere. </p>

<p>i'll search for your face in a crowd, listen to an ensemble just to hear your voice, and watch you cry your emotions out. because i love every aspect of you. whether its your freaky side, your cringe side, or your insecure side. i don't care, i care about you feeling loved. i want you to feel loved because you deserve it. you deserve every good thing that happens to you. i don't know how long we'll last, where we'll be in the far future, and i dont know when it'll be our final talk— but until  then, let's start with the unit of time: forever. we don't know what'll happen in the future, we dont know what'll come our way. but i'll be right by your side yesterday, today, tomorrow, and the next couple of forevers that come our way. </p>

<p>if i die, don't grieve that much. care for yourself, love life, find another woman that'll treat you better— because i want to see that cute smile of yours even though i'm no longer in this world. study hard, but not too hard to the point that you'll forget to care for yourself. live life, but don't do anything that you dont want to. and find another woman, but when you look into her eyes, don't think of me. think of her as her own person, as a new beginning for you if something happens. if something happens, i want to be assured that you'll be safe and sound. if something happens, i'll be by the gates of the other side waiting for another late night yap sesh. if something happens, just know that i still love you. </p> 

<p>i'll love every single aspect of you. no matter how many times you'll call yourself untrue things like useless, ugly or anything else— i'll still support every decision you make. because i'm not just your girlfriend, yet also your best friend, kakampi, and number one supporter. i love you as much as there are many universes in this lifetime, my sirius. i love you as long as humans can comprehend with a brain, my  nerd. i love you so much, my ethan. happy valentines (★^O^★) !! </p>
 
<p> thank you for staying with me for our second valentines. ⋆˚꩜｡ </p>
